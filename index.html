        <strong>Description: </strong>You begin in a simple era. Bats and rock missile launchers were used by cavemen. From cave dwellers riding dinosaurs to the futuristic hover tanks of the future age, each age provides totally new units and weapons. Age of War is a massive base defense strategy game in which you fight a never-ending battle. Continue to build units to defend your base and eliminate the opponent. Your civilization will progress over the ages as you gain enough XP, providing new technologies to use in war. To continue in the game, you must build enough units and turrets to withstand your opponent's pressure while still creating enough force to reach their base. Set up turrets and construct additional places for more defensive weapons to defend your headquarters.
